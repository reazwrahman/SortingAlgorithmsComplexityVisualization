# SortingAlgorithmsComplexityVisualization 

In this project, I wrote down the algorithms for insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort. I have written a class to generate different types randomized lists and a timing analysis class in Java to record the computation time taken by each algorithm to sort those random lists of increasing size. All of these are written in Java.

For the next part of this project, I have written a program in Python to read the computation time from the previous part and generate individual graphs showing the stark contrast in total computation time for these three algorithms. This aids as a good visualization tool to understand the difference in complexity of these three algorithms and help put the omega notation into perspective. 

To run java part of the program: java Main.java 
to graph in Python: Python3 Complexity_Grapher.py
